# Music Importer

I wasn't satisifed with the lack of filtering and sorting for Music on MacOS 11.5.2 (20G95).

I made this script so I could import songs in their album-order. By default, Music imports songs in their lexicographical order and ignores song number prefixes.

## Instruction

The script requires the following:
* **Only include audio files**
* All song files you want to import are in the directory you point the script to
  * Don't include sperate folders containing song files
